# aegis_bringup

This package provides the configuration and launch files required to enable all basic functionalities of the Aegis robot station.

## Launch files

- `bringup.launch.py`: Responsible for running the entire ROS 2 stack for the robot station.

## Run the project

> [!CAUTION]
> Never startup the project on the real hardware unattended!

1. Ensure that the `ros2_driver` program on the robot is loaded, and the robot is set to the `Remote` mode (the top-right corner on the teach pendant).

2. Run the main launch file:
```bash
ros2 launch aegis_bringup bringup.launch.py
```
```bash
ros2 launch aegis_bringup bringup.launch.py mock_hardware:=false launch_rviz:=true
```

Possible launch arguments:
* `mock_hardware:={false, true}` (default: `false`) - enables the _fake_hardware_ feature of the ros2_control (the simplest "simulation").
* `launch_rviz:={false, true}` (default: `true`) - launches visualization in RViz.

3. Start the client program on the robot via dashboard service:
```bash
ros2 service call /dashboard_client/play std_srvs/srv/Trigger {}
```
